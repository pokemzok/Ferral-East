TODO 0
# 1 Add items to my shop (sharik can sell weapon upgades for now and maybe one more item, I could add god favours logic later on).
# 2 I created pretty nice shop, but AI did messed up some Sharik parts, so I wonder If I can turn it into feature. 
		For example: Welcome to the shop beyond time and space. Here it is better to not stare too much, so you can avoid perception disturbance.

TODO 1
# 0. After 10th wave go to Balbir for the summary.
# 1. Revisit increasing of the difficulty level after those changes and try to nudge it into the right direction.

TODO 2
# 1. New test level which would allow pathfinding. 
# 2. New zombie enemy (different color) which would be smarter (will use pathfinding) and would be reanimating once with less HP.
# 3. Maybe a miniboss as well, basically same guy as Surbi, but more HP 
# 4. Score should take into consideration time it took player to complete wave. Wave counts as started after player completed leveling up.

TODO 3
# 1. At least 5 levels, which would all have ten waves -> this way I would allow Surbi to be completely upgraded till the end of the game.
# 2. Transition to next level after completing 10 wave (no saves).
# 3. Player keeps all the powers during transitions.
# 4. Defeating the last level (probably a necromancer house) with a necromancer boss (skeleton from my song)
# 5. After the last boss fight prompt player with: do you want to continue? Which will esencially do infinity waves on the last map. Alternatively give a player a new game plus. If the player completes it 3 times, we can give the playe true ending (singlehandedly defeated all necromancer spawns).
# 6. Add Gods favours to Sharik Shop (could be indicated as a numbers under the ammunition on player HUD)

TODO 4
# 1. Find a way to prevent animation from looping on death (zombie does not need looping when they die, or Surbi) 
# 2. limit fire rate (maybe this would help for reload glitch)
# 3. Make whistle sound (end of the wave) louder.
# 4. Make cactus hurt player and enemy
# 2. Cat should try to reach the coins if there are any (later on, when I would have a pathfinding)

# TODO 5
# 0. Resolution scaling (I  want for the player to  be able to pick a resolution)
# 1. Nicer menu and loading screens
# 1.1 Some interesting background as well
# 1.2 Sounds on clicking on the main menu (not on options since that would be just annoying)
# 2. Sound design (replace music you get from pixabay by your own custom)
# 2.1 Sound volume normalization (i  want same level of audio for all of my samples)
# 2.2 More custome made songs for my game ( find or create so i  can swap my  first choices)
# 3. More enemy types.
# 6. Level design improvements?
# 7. Totems logic? -  the idea is that Surbi would find item, which would on right click do something (like for example teleport  or second revolver). Player can switch between second power using scroll or num pad.
# 8. Shit-talking dialogue lines for Surbi, when he performes good (score is high)
# 9. Multiplayer (local PC hosting a server for the other who knows the ID and password)
# 10. Start release process to see how difficult it is.
# 11. Make background images in menu  zoom in and out, also change them from time to  time.

# For future
# Halina is a melee (higher damage, more health, ability to regenerate between waves)
# Aneta is faster runner but slower gunner

# Potential powers:
	# Surbi otrzymuje drugi rewolwer i większą prędkość  strzelania
	# Aneta wpada w  panikę, więc biega jeszcze szybciej a  jej strzały zadają więcej obrażeń.
	# Halina dostaje  większe klapki i god mode na  kilka sekund i zabija wszystkich na hita

# Potenial enemy behaviours:
	# Fake death, some zombie will  get up after a while
	# necromancer apprentice - can  reanimate fallen zombie, which are still spawned on the ground
