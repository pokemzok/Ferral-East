TODO 0
# 1. Maybe a boss as well, basically same guy as Surbi, but more HP.
# 2. I need all the animations for Kilt Weston.
# 3. I need  AI for Kilt. It should move around a lot and fire on Surbi previous position (some delay, so the player could react). 
#    Kilt needs to be aware of terrain so he would not be stuck on cactuses.
# 4. I need a boss spawn, so bosses could appear from the specific places.

TODO 1
# 1. Make Sharik in Blender, so I can try generating resources from it.

TODO 2
# 5. I might need to rework my SurvivalGameMode to extract spawning algorithm.
# 6. I can also trigger dialogue between both guys. 
# 7. TODO learn blender so I can make more realistic animations.

TODO 3
# 0. After 10th wave go to Balbir for the summary.
# 1. Revisit increasing of the difficulty level after those changes and try to nudge it into the right direction.

TODO 4
# 1. At least 5 levels, which would all have ten waves -> this way I would allow Surbi to be completely upgraded till the end of the game.
# 2. Transition to next level after completing 10 wave (no saves).
# 3. Player keeps all the powers during transitions.
# 4. A this stage I would also want to have plot dialogues between Surbi and bosses (those were skipped to save time previously).
# 4. Defeating the last level (probably a necromancer house) with a necromancer boss (skeleton from my song)
# 5. After the last boss fight prompt player with: do you want to continue? Which will esencially do infinity waves on the last map. Alternatively give a player a new game plus. If the player completes it 3 times, we can give the playe true ending (singlehandedly defeated all necromancer spawns).
# 6. Maybe refactor items so they would have modes instead of being shop dedicated. For example I might want to cell cylinder in shop as well, but I need to somehow scale that item  better in the shop.
# 7. Add stones later on,  so they could be a  "funny" item without reason to carry  it.
# 8. Add Gods favours to Sharik Shop (could be indicated as a numbers under the ammunition on player HUD)
# 9. Fix Sharik dialogues, when I finally have everything

TODO 5
# 1. Make user only have 3 pockets (currently it is not limited) and add "threads and needles" item to increase pocket nr.
# 2. Make user have a limit of how much he can carry.
# 1. Find a way to prevent animation from looping on death (zombie does not need looping when they die, or Surbi) 
# 2. limit fire rate (maybe this would help for reload glitch)
# 3. Make whistle sound (end of the wave) louder.
# 4. Make cactus hurt player and enemy
# 2. Cat should try to reach the coins if there are any (later on, when I would have a pathfinding)

# TODO 6
# 0. Resolution scaling (I  want for the player to  be able to pick a resolution)
# 1. Nicer menu and loading screens
# 1.1 Some interesting background as well
# 1.2 Sounds on clicking on the main menu (not on options since that would be just annoying)
# 2. Sound design (replace music you get from pixabay by your own custom)
# 2.1 Sound volume normalization (i  want same level of audio for all of my samples)
# 2.2 More custome made songs for my game ( find or create so i  can swap my  first choices)
# 3. More enemy types.
# 6. Level design improvements?
# 7. Totems logic? -  the idea is that Surbi would find item, which would on right click do something (like for example teleport  or second revolver). Player can switch between second power using scroll or num pad.
# 8. Shit-talking dialogue lines for Surbi, when he performes good (score is high)
# 9. Multiplayer (local PC hosting a server for the other who knows the ID and password)
# 10. Start release process to see how difficult it is.
# 11. Make background images in menu  zoom in and out, also change them from time to  time.
# 12. Sharik prices might be influenced by how many times he was shot by the player
# 13. Score should take into consideration dmg tooked by player to complete wave (the more dmg the more the minus gets). Wave counts as started after player completed leveling up.


# For future
# Halina is a melee (higher damage, more health, ability to regenerate between waves)
# Aneta is faster runner but slower gunner

# Potential powers:
	# Surbi shoots all bullets like a machine gun.
	# Aneta wpada w  panikę, więc biega jeszcze szybciej a  jej strzały zadają więcej obrażeń.
	# Halina dostaje  większe klapki i god mode na  kilka sekund i zabija wszystkich na hita

# Potenial enemy behaviours:
	# Fake death, some zombie will  get up after a while
	# necromancer apprentice - can  reanimate fallen zombie, which are still spawned on the ground
