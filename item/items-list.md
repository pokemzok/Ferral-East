For later:
1. catnip (kocimiautka) - can be bough from Sharik. Heals + make you high (like some LSD colors for a while).
2. Unlimited Revolver - can be bought from Sharik. This revolver does not limit upgrades. You can have as much as you want.
3. Sercya(Sercja) - Mana Potion + make you drunk for a while
4. Profet Sercya - Looks like mana potion, but when encountered, will speak: Don't drink me, mate! On drink ocasionally will speak lots of nonsence in your head. Like I want a list of at least 20 nonsences. Might react to player actions. Text should appear in italic above Player head.  It will always start from: Mate, you really shouldn't drank me, now you stuck with me for live.
