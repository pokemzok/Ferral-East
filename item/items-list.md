1. Pentagram - Health Potion, add one Health until Surbi reaches 10 hearts, then it adds perma regen
2. Revolver cylinder - adds one bullet to a revolver cylinder
3. Second Revolver - appears only after all revolver upgrades (cylinders) are picked.

For later:
1. New gloves? - reload speed update
2. Sercya(Sercja) - Mana Potion + make you drunk for a while
3. Profet Sercya - Looks like mana potion, but when encountered, will speak: Don't drink me, mate! On drink ocasionally will speak lots of nonsence in your head. Like I want a list of at least 20 nonsences. Might react to player actions. Text should appear in italic above Player head.  It will always start from: Mate, you really shouldn't drank me, now you stuck with me for live.
